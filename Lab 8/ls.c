 * Program to stimulate the ls command of Linux operating system.
 * The ls command lists all the files present in the given directory.
 * The <dirent.h> header defines the following data type through typedef:
 *     DIR is a type representing the directory stream.
 *     It also defines a structure called dirent, which has the members:
 *           => ino_t d_ino //File serial name.
 *           => char d_name //Name of the directory.
 * The type ino_t is defined in the header <sys/types.h>, and is used for file serial numbers.
 * The . present in the output represents the current directory.
 * The .. present in the output represents the parent directory.
