/*******************************************************************************************************************
 * Program to demonstrate the creation of a zombie process.
 * A Zombie process is a a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
 * The following system calls are used to demonstrate the zombie process:
 *     =>  pid_t getpid() returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process.
 *     =>  pid_t getppid() returns the process ID of the parent of the calling process.
 *     =>  pid_t wait(int *wstatus) suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.
 *     =>  sleep() causes the calling thread to sleep either:
           1) Until the number of real-time seconds specified in seconds have elapsed or
           2) Until a signal arrives which is not ignored.
           Prototype: unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds)
